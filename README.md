## What is this?

This is a pet project of mine to take the very interesting [Bulma](bulma.io) CSS framework and integrate it into a Jekyll starter theme. I like Jekyll and use it frequently enough and wanted to save myself the time of setting up the assets every time. Feel free to use this as you see fit, I made it for personal use and I make no claims to being very good at managing web assets.
